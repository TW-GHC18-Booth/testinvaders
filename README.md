Coder
=====
A little browser based BDD Dojo app with exercises aimed at teaching how to write specs.

This project is aimed at reducing the barrier to entry of learning how to write tests.

Check it out: http://coder.heroku.com/

Usage
-----
```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/akiellor/coder
$ cd coder
$ bundle
$ rackup
```

Navigate to http://localhost:9292/ in your browser.

Status
------
Basics are there:

* Load/Edit/Run Specs
* Lessons loaded from lessons dir.

Needs:

* More content.
* An index of lessons for populating navigation.
* Perhaps a vt100 code parse to get colored output (nice to have).
* Save changes...only looking at browser storage now.

What You Can Do!
----------------
The most important part of this project is the content, I welcome pull requests with any content (include attribution).
