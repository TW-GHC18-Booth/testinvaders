# testinvaders

A course on fast feedback, test-driven development, and automated deployment.

## How do I play?

### The easy way!

1. <http://testinvaders.heroku.com/>

### The hard way!

1. `$ bundle install`
1. `$ shotgun`
1. <http://localhost:9393/>

## How do I contribute?

### The easy way!

1. Get two or more friends.
1. Arrange them in pairs.
1. Sit each pair in front of [testinvaders](http://testinvaders.heroku.com/).
  1. Ask them to fix the obvious bug.
  1. Ask them to fix a not-obvious bug.
  1. Ask them to add a feature.
1. Log those painful stumbling points as [issues](https://github.com/quad/testinvaders/issues/new)!

### The hard way!

1. `$ rake spec`
1. `$ rake jasmine:ci`  
   n.b. there should always be one failing test as the student needs to start somewhere.

## How do I marvel?

Andrew Kiellor started this all with his [unfinished dream][coder].

Natalie Drucker and Scott Shaw gave opportunities and expectations.

[Ryan Boucher][ryan] and Mike Gardiner wrote the game and exercises. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Brad Ward, [Ray Grasso][ray], and Rohit Maurya provided invaluable feedback.
